# Amino
Aggregate data and R scripts used to interpret and plot HPLC and Raman spectroscopy data related to amino acid preservation within Martian regolith simulants.

Data is divided in three main branches:

The HPLC branch holds scripts needed for the analysis and generation of plots encompassing the chromatographic analysis.
The Raman branch contains scripts needed for the analysis and plotting of Raman spectroscopic data.
The Regolith characterization branch has a couple scripts related to the characterization of the mineral surfaces.

All branches contain sub-branches with the raw data used in analysis and plotting.
